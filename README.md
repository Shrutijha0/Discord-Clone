# Discord-Clone
Discord clone using HTML and TailwindCSS

Welcome to my Discord Clone Website! This project is a web-based clone inspired by the popular communication platform, Discord. It's built entirely using HTML and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to work seamlessly across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience for users on both desktop and mobile.

Tailwind CSS: The project leverages the power of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to style the components and layout efficiently.

User Interface: The user interface closely mimics Discord's interface, featuring a navigation bar, server channels, chat section, and user profile panel.

Static Content: As a static website, the content is fixed and doesn't have dynamic functionality like real-time chat. However, it demonstrates the design and layout skills used in creating a complex web application.
